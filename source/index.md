#### Welcome!

I'm a software engineer with interest in light transport algorithms, realtime graphics and digital signal processing. I have recently finished an MSc in Computer Science with focus on Visual Computing at ETHZ. During my studies, I have closely worked with [Disney Research ZÃ¼rich](https://www.disneyresearch.com) and also had the opportunity to contribute to Disney's [Hyperion](https://www.disneyanimation.com/technology/innovations/hyperion) renderer during an internship abroad. Before my studies, I have worked as a software engineer with focus on embedded systems for several years.

I'm currently looking for a job, feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:simon.kallweit@gmail.com).
