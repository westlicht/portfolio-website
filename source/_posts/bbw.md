# Bring Back Winter

Bring Back Winter is a puzzle game I have developed in collaboration with Benedikt Bitterli and Marcel Marti as a semester project for the ETHZ course "Game Programming Lab" in 2013. It won the Jury Price for Best Game.

I was responsible for the development of a cross platform game engine, written from scratch in C++11, supporting Windows, OSX and Linux. This included a framework for OpenGL based graphics, a custom GUI system, as well as the audio subsystem. Furthermore I have developed parts of the game logic, an in-game level editor and a custom sound engine to create realtime water sound effects based on the fluid simulation data.

You can download the finished game [here](http://bbw.weirdsoft.ch).
