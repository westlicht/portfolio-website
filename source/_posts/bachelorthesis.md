### Photon Beam Methods in Rendering

This thesis covers rendering methods for participating media, with special focus on recent photon beam methods. We study the theory for rendering with participating media and discuss, among others, four particular rendering methods: Progressive Photon Beams, Virtual Ray Lights, Photon Diffusion and Photon Beam Diffusion. We have reviewed and refactored an existing cross-platform renderer and extended it with consistent implementations of the presented rendering methods. Using our renderer, we are able to compare the rendering methods and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.
